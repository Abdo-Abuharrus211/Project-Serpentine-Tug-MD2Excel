Independent Auditors’ Report on Review of

Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements

To the Shareholders of First Abu Dhabi Bank P.J.S.C

```
Introduction
```

```
We have reviewed the accompanying 30 June 2022 condensed consolidated interim financial
statements of First Abu Dhabi Bank P.J.S.C. (“the Bank”) and its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as “the Group”), which comprises:
```

```
 the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022;
 the condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss for the three-month and
six-month periods ended 30 June 2022;
 the condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income for the three-
month and six-month periods ended 30 June 2022;
 the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity for the six-month
period ended 30 June 2022;
 the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows for the six-month period
ended 30 June 2022; and
 notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
```

```
Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this condensed
consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, ‘Interim Financial
Reporting’. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this condensed consolidated
interim financial statements based on our review.
```

```
Scope of Review
```

```
We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review
Engagements 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity”. A review of condensed consolidated interim financial statements
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an
audit opinion.

The merger was effected through the issuance of 1.254 new NBAD shares for every 1 share in FGB on close of business 30 March
2017, subsequent to which FGB shares were delisted from Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. On 25 April 2017, NBAD shareholders

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform:
```

```
A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, replacing some Interbank offered rates
(“IBORs”) with alternative risk-free benchmark reference rate (“RFRs”). The Group has significant exposure to certain IBORs on its
financial instruments that are being reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives.
```

```
IBORs, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plays a critical role in global financial markets, serving as reference
rates for derivatives, Loans, advances and Islamic financing, and as parameters in the valuation of financial instruments. It is
primarily replaced by overnight RFRs, administered by local rate administrators. With the exception of SARON and ESTR
(an overnight replacement rates for CHF LIBOR and EUR LIBOR), term rates are available for all other RFRs.
```

```
On 5 March 2021, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced the future cessation or loss of representativeness dates of all
LIBOR tenors across all currencies. FCA concluded that all Non-USD LIBOR (GBP, JPY, CHF and EUR) and selected tenors of USD LIBOR
(1-week and 2-month) will either cease to exist or become non-representative after 31 December 2021, while remaining USD LIBOR
tenors will continue till 30 June 2023. Global regulators had recommended Banks to cease issuance of new LIBOR linked products
(including USD LIBOR) after 31 December 2021. Consistent with this announcement, as of 31 December 2021 a formal cessation
was triggered for all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY settings as well as the 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings.
```

```
The Group continues to coordinate and oversee the transition from IBORs to RFRs with no significant changes to the project or
transition risks disclosed in Note 45 (c) of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. The
project plan continues to be on target and the Group continues to progress on its transition plan for the remaining USD LIBOR
settings which will cease to be published immediately after 30 June 2023. The Group continue to monitor industry developments
in this space and have also implemented controls to ensure new USD LIBOR trades are for permitted purposes only during this
transition.
```

```
FAB’s approach towards IBOR Transition
```

```
Loans, Bonds and other On Balance Sheet exposures
```

```
FAB initiated its IBOR transition project in 2019. The Project is sponsored by the Group CFO and is being led by senior representatives
from functions across the Group including the client facing teams, Legal, Finance, Operations and Technology. The Group has
maintained its momentum in tracking its exposure to IBORs, preparing its IT systems to accommodate the incoming Risk-Free Rates,
amending, or preparing contractual templates and communicating its progress with both the Regulators and its clients. The Project
provides monthly progress updates to the Project sponsors. The Group has successfully achieved the transition for a significant
portion of its IBOR exposure to RFRs as of 31 December 2021 and has in place detailed plans, processes, and procedures to support
the transition of the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings before 30 June 2023.
```

```
For contracts indexed to an IBOR that mature after the expected cessation of the IBOR rate, the Group has established policies to
amend the contractual terms. These amendments include the addition of fallback clauses or replacement of the IBOR rate with an
alternative benchmark rate.
```

```
As at 3 0 June 2022, the IBOR reform in respect of currencies to which the Group has exposure has been largely completed. The
table below sets out the IBOR rates that the Group had exposure to, the new benchmark rates to which these exposures have or
are being transitioned, and the status of the transition.

```

```
In line with the regulatory guidance, FAB will continue to actively transition LIBOR products to suitable alternatives where possible.
However, if this is not achieved, those products will use synthetic LIBOR where applicable and until they are transitioned.
```

```
Derivatives and hedge accounting
```

```
The Group holds derivatives for trading and risk management purposes. Derivatives held for risk management purposes are
designated in hedging relationships. The interest rate and cross-currency swaps have floating legs that are indexed to various IBORs.
On 23 October 2020, International Swaps and Derivatives Association (‘ISDA’) reviewed its definitions in light of IBOR reform and
issued an IBOR fallbacks supplement. This sets out how the amendments to new alternative benchmark rates (e.g. SOFR, SONIA) in
the 2006 ISDA definitions will be accomplished. The effect of the supplement is to create fallback provisions in derivatives that
describe what floating rates will apply on the permanent discontinuation of certain key IBORs or on ISDA declaring a non-
representative determination of an IBOR.
```

```
The Group had adhered to the adoption of the ISDA protocol as a fallback provision, which came into effect in January 2021, and
the successful changes made by clearing houses to discount derivatives using the euro short-term rate (‘€STR’) and SOFR, to reduce
the risk of a disorderly transition of the derivatives market. If derivative counterparties also adhere to the protocol, then new
fallbacks will be automatically implemented in existing derivative contracts. Consequently, the Group is monitoring whether its
counterparties will also adhere to the protocol and, if there are counterparties that will not, then the Group plans to negotiate with
them bilaterally about inclusion of new fallback clauses.
```

```
Hedging relationships impacted by uncertainty about IBOR reform may experience ineffectiveness attributable to market
participants’ expectations of when the shift from the existing IBOR benchmark rate to an alternative benchmark interest rate will
occur. This transition may occur at different times for the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which may lead to hedge
ineffectiveness.
```

```
The objective of the majority of these hedges and consistent with the overall interest rate risk management strategy of FAB is to
reduce fluctuations of the fair value of bonds purchased by FAB or its own issuances which pay a fixed rate and also reduce
fluctuations from foreign exchange risk if these are denominated in another currency that is not AED or USD.
```

```
Standard Issued but not yet Effective
```

```
The following new standard and amendments to the standards are applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2023 and early application is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and
amendments to the standards and expects to adopt them on the effective date.
```

- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1).
- IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
- Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2).
- Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8).
- Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)

Basis of consolidation
```

```
Subsidiaries are investees that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls the investee if it meets the control criteria. The
Group reassesses whether it has control if, there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. This includes circumstances
in which protective rights held become substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee. The financial statements
of subsidiaries are included in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements from the date that control commences
until the date that control ceases.
```

```
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) are attributed to the equity holders of the Bank and to
the non-controlling interests (“NCI”), even if this results in the NCI having a deficit balance.
```

```
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Bank and those of its following

## 4 Use of estimates and judgements

```
The preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
```

```
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in
applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those that were
applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021.
```

```
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

```
Tier 1 capital notes are perpetual, subordinated, unsecured and carry coupons to be paid semi-annually in arrears. The Bank may elect
not to pay a coupon at its own discretion. The note holder does not have a right to claim the coupon and an election by the Bank not
to service coupon is not considered an event of default. In addition, there are certain circumstances under which the Bank is prohibited
from making a coupon payment on a relevant coupon payment date.
```

```
If the Bank makes a non-payment election or a non-payment event occurs, then the Bank will not (a) declare or pay any distribution
or dividend or (b) redeem, purchase, cancel, reduce or otherwise acquire any of the share capital or any securities of the Bank ranking
pari passu with or junior to the notes except securities, the term of which stipulate a mandatory redemption or conversion into equity,
in each case unless or until two consecutive coupon payments have been paid in full.
```

```
During the period, the coupon payment election was made by the Bank amounting to AED 177,641 thousand
( 30 June 2021 : AED 181 ,7 00 thousand).
```

## 18 Share based payment

```
The Group had introduced in 2008 a share based payment scheme (the “Scheme”) for selected employees which would vest over
three years and can be exercised within the next three years after the vesting period. The key vesting condition is that the option
holder is in continued employment with the Bank until the end of the vesting period. The options lapse six years after their date of
grant irrespective of whether they are exercised or not.
```

```
The Group established a subsidiary to issue shares when the vested option is exercised by the employee. These shares are treated as
treasury shares until exercised by the option holders.
```

```
During the period, Nil shares (3 0 June 2021: 1,665 thousand) have been awarded, therefore reallocated from treasury shares held to
share capital by AED Nil (3 0 June 2021: AED 1,665 thousand) and share premium has been adjusted by AED Nil (3 0 June 2021: AED
12 , 643 thousand) accordingly relating to this.

## 30 Financial risk management

```
Credit risk
```

```
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial asset fails to meet its contractual obligations and cause the Group
to incur a financial loss. It arises principally from the Group’s loans, advances and Islamic financing, due from banks and financial
institutions, reverse repurchase agreements and non-trading debt investments, derivative financial instruments and certain other
assets.
```

```
COVID-19 and Expected Credit Loss (ECL)
```

```
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. In light of the rapid spread
of COVID-19 across the globe, various economies and sectors have faced significant disruptions and uncertainty and governments and
authorities have instigated a host of measures to contain or delay the spread of the virus.
```

```
In line with other global regulators, the Central Bank of the UAE (“CBUAE”), under the Targeted Economic Support Scheme (“TESS”),
had facilitated the provision of temporary relief from the payments or deferral of principal and/or interest / profit on outstanding
loans for all affected private sector corporates, SMEs and individuals with specific conditions.
```

```
CBUAE phased out the deferrals under TESS by end of 31 December 2021, however, it had extended the relief granted under TESS for
capital, liquidity and stable funding requirements, to all banks operating in the UAE, from 31 December 2021 to 30 June 2022.
```

```
Currently, there are no deferral relief considered under TESS programme as of 30 June 2022 , however, CBUAE had extended the relief
granted under TESS whereby Banks and finance companies may offer new working capital loans, bridge loans, or any other new
financing to private sector corporates, SMEs, and individuals in the UAE under the TESS recovery program to facilitate provision of
relief and recovery of their corresponding customers negatively affected by COVID-19 repercussions until June 2022. Currently, the
Group does not have any new exposures granted under the TESS Recovery programme as of 3 0 June 2022.
```

```
The Group continues to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Bank’s portfolio.
```

```
Deferral amounts of UAE customers
```

```
As at 3 0 June 2022, the total deferrals provided to customers as a result of COVID-19 was AED 14 , 447 million (31 December 2021: AED
14 , 360 million), and all the deferrals have been regularized in accordance with the Bank’s policy at the end of the current period.
```

## 30 Financial risk management (continued)

**Credit risk** _(continued)_

```
The Group measures its exposure to credit risk by reference to the gross carrying amount of financial assets less amounts offset, interest suspended and impairment losses, if any. The
carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

**31 Financial assets and liabilities** _(continued)_

```
Financial instruments measured at fair value - hierarchy (continued)
```

```
The Management considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recognised in the condensed consolidated
interim financial statements do not materially differ from their fair values.
```

```
The valuation techniques and inputs used in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are same as those
prescribed in the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021.
```

## 32 Business combination

```
On 28 April 2021, the Bank acquired 100% of the share capital of Bank Audi SAE (Egypt), Bank Audi’s subsidiary in Egypt. The
acquisition was effected through transfer of cash from the acquiror to the acquiree. The acquisition was effected to accelerate FAB
Group’s expansion in high-potential market. It will significantly increase the size, scale and experience of FAB Egypt, adding greater
depth and reach to customers both locally and globally.
```

```
a. Purchase consideration
```

```
The purchase consideration paid for the acquisition of 100% shares is USD 600 million (equivalent to AED 2,203 million).
```

```
b. Integration related costs
```

```
The Group incurred integration-related costs of AED 68 million for the six month period ended 3 0 June 22 (30 June 2021 AED 55
million), relating to consultant and external legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs have been included in ‘General,
administrative and other operating expenses’ in the condensed consolidated interim statement of profit or loss.
```

```
c. Valuation approach and methodologies:
```

```
Customer relationship
```

```
The income approach has been used in estimating the fair value of Bank Audi SAE (Egypt)’s customer relationships as an intangible
asset as at the transaction date. The income approach values the customer relationship as the present value of the future earnings
that it is expected to generate over its remaining useful economic life. Under the income approach, the Multi-period excess earnings
method (“MEEM”) has been utilized which is a commonly accepted method for valuing customer relationships.
```

```
Core deposits
```

```
The income approach, favourable source of funds method has been used to arrive at the value for core deposits. This is calculated
based on the present value of the difference between the cost of existing core deposits and cost of obtaining most favourable
market alternative funds which represents the marginal funding that the bank has access to, over the determined useful life of the
core deposit base.
```

```
Loan Portfolio
```

```
In determining the valuation of loans, Expected Cash Flow approach, Present value approach and Recovery rate approach have been
used.
```

```
Real estate assets
```

```
Real estate assets have been valued using the Market approach and the Income approach. The valuation analysis was conducted in
accordance with RICS Valuation – Professional Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (the “Red Book”)
and complies with International Valuation Standards (IVS).
```

```
Customer deposits
```

```
Customer deposits were valued using the income approach where origination rates on deposits were used to discount future cash
flows associated with them based on the weighted average interest rate.
```

**32 Business Combination** _(continued)_

```
c. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
```

```
The following table summarises the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities considered on the date of acquisition.

```
As a result of the purchase price allocation (PPA) exercise, the 2021 comparative information has been restated to reflect the
adjustments to the assumed carrying amounts, as stated above.
```

```
d. Goodwill and Intangibles
```

```
During the period, the purchase price allocation exercise was completed and, consequently, carrying value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as at acquisition date have been adjusted from the provisional amounts to the fair value. As a result, there was
an increase in goodwill by AED 974 million over the provisional amount. The impact arising as a result of PPA exercise has been
adjusted to the amount of goodwill as below:
```

```
AED’000
Total consideration 2,203,800
Bank Audi SAE (Egypt) net assets value (887,249)
----------------------------------
Goodwill 1,316,551
===============
```

**32 Business Combination** **_(continued)_**

```
e. Goodwill and Intangibles (continued)
```

```
The Group has completed a comprehensive purchase price allocation within twelve months from the acquisition date and following
items are covered:
```

- valuation of intangible assets.
- valuation of properties and equipment.
- valuation adjustments on other recognized financial and non-financial assets and liabilities; and
- initial adjustments to fair value of loans, advances and Islamic financing.

```
The goodwill is attributable mainly to the synergies expected to be achieved from acquisition in high potential market.
```

```
f. Impact on Group’s results
```

```
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021, management estimate that consolidated operating income and profit for the
period would be AED 46 8 million and AED 8 7 million respectively for the period between 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021. In
determining these amounts, the Group has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the
date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2021.
